# PAGES - A Book Search Engine
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  ## Description
  
  - To exercise my developing REACT.js skills, I took starter code with a fully functioning book API search engine built with a RESTful API backend and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
  - To make the GraphQL API and Apollo Server possible, I implemented the following React Hooks and techniques :
    - TypeDefs and Resolvers
    - Queries and Mutations
    - JSON Web Tokens, JWB
    
    
  The following are animations of the application in use.
